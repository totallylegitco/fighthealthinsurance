Hello {{name}},

First off, thank you for using Fight Health Insurance to generate an appeal and choosing to use our fax service!.

{% if success %}
Our records indicate the fax was sent successfully. You should still call your insurance company to confirm receipt as they love to try and weasel out of it.
{% else %}
It seems like there may have been a problem sending the fax. This is fairly common, but you can try to re-send the fax for free.
{% endif %}

If you would like to re-send the fax, or send it to another number, go to {{fax_redo_link}}

We'd love it if you continued to share us with others who might need help with their insurance, especially professionals.

Wishing you the best of luck with your fight with insurance,


Holden :)
